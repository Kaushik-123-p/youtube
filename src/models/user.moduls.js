    bcrypt vs bcrypt.js: What‚Äôs the Difference?
Both bcrypt and bcrypt.js are libraries used for hashing passwords securely in Node.js. However, they have key differences in implementation and performance.

-----------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ bcrypt (Native Library)
üìå bcrypt is a C++ native library that requires compilation.

Uses native bindings (written in C++) for better performance.

Requires Node.js build tools (e.g., node-gyp) to install.

Faster than bcrypt.js because it uses hardware acceleration.

May cause installation issues on some systems due to compilation dependencies.

Installation
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install bcrypt
---------------------------

2Ô∏è‚É£ bcrypt.js (Pure JavaScript Library)
üìå bcrypt.js is a pure JavaScript implementation.

Does not require native dependencies.

Slower than bcrypt because it runs in JavaScript, without C++ optimizations.

More portable and easier to install (no compilation issues).

Installation
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install bcryptjs


======================================================================

What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
üìå JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure way to authenticate users and transmit data between a client and a server.

It is commonly used for user authentication in web applications.

A JWT is self-contained, meaning it contains all the necessary information inside it.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Use JWT?
‚úÖ Authentication ‚Äì Used for login and user verification.
‚úÖ Security ‚Äì Ensures data integrity with signatures (HMAC, RSA, etc.).
‚úÖ Stateless ‚Äì No need to store sessions in a database.
‚úÖ Fast & Scalable ‚Äì Reduces server load because the token is verified locally.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Structure of a JWT
A JWT consists of three parts:

Header ‚Äì Contains metadata about the token (e.g., algorithm, token type).

Payload ‚Äì Contains user data (e.g., userId, email).

Signature ‚Äì A cryptographic signature to ensure the token is not tampered with.

=============================================================================================
we can not directly encrypt the code if we want ro encrpt the code then w we used to mongoose hooks
pre
post
etc...

this hooks monstly used in model(schema)

Mongoose Hooks (Middleware)
üìå Mongoose Hooks (also called Middleware) allow you to execute logic before or after certain actions like saving, updating, deleting, or validating documents in MongoDB.

------------------------
2Ô∏è‚É£ Pre Hook (pre)
Runs before a document is saved, updated, or deleted.

Useful for hashing passwords, validating data, etc.

How it Works?

Before saving a user (pre("save")), this function hashes the password.

Prevents plain-text passwords from being stored.

------------------------
3Ô∏è‚É£ Post Hook (post)
Runs after a document is saved, updated, or deleted.

Useful for logging actions, sending notifications, etc.

‚úîÔ∏è How it Works?

After a user is saved, it logs a success message.

------------------------------------------------------------

Using Hooks with Different Actions
Hook Type	Example Usage
pre("save")	Hash passwords before saving.
post("save")	Log when a document is saved.
pre("remove")	Perform cleanup before deleting a user.
post("remove")	Log when a user is deleted.
pre("findOneAndUpdate")	Modify data before updating a document.
post("findOneAndUpdate")	Log changes after an update.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
when you used mngoose hooks in this can not used callback function or arrow function becouse of arrow functionncan not have this keyword reference and its can not  known about contenx

prefer to used simple function function declaration

============================================================
encryption is a complex  performamce becouse its algorithm preccessing cpu peoceessing take the time  that's     why it take a time
